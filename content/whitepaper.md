As part of the  [UN Ocean Decade Laboratories](https://www.oceandecade-conference.com/en/ocean-decade-laboratories.html),
we are crowdsourcing input for a White Paper.
This activity will help answer the following question:
**What are the organizational, technical and community activities needed to advance the OpenOceanCloud?**

How to participate:
1. Join the GatherTown community (link coming soon)
1. Watch the video
1. Read the questions
1. Submit your ideas

### Intro: What is OpenOceanCloud?

The OpenOceanCloud vision was presented by Ryan Abernathey as a plenary lecture at the
[U.S. Ocean Decade Launch Meeting](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/02-02-2021/ocean-decade-us-launch-meeting) consisted of a 2-day virtual meeting.
If you're new to the OpenOceanCloud community, this 8 minute video provides a quick introduction and overview

### The WhitePaper Process

We have three themes, with specific sub questions where we are seeking input.
If you are interested in participating,  first watch the [intro video].
Then read through the questions and submit one or more response paragraphs (link below).

#### Theme 1: Co-Development of OpenOceanCloud Technology and Infrastructure

1. Data: What data are needed to address crucial ocean science and policy challenges? Are these data FAIR and available in Analysis-Ready Cloud Optimized (ARCO) format? What gaps are there and how can we close them?
1. Software: What are the key analysis tools needed by ocean scientists? What open software tools should OpenOceanCloud leverage in its platform? What gaps in functionality exist and need to be filled?
1. Computing Infrastructure: How do we best develop and maintain interactive, data-proximate computing, available to anyone? Which organizations should fund and operate this infrastructure?

#### Theme 2: How can OpenOceanCloud engage, organize, and empower a diverse community of participants?

1. How can we build an open, diverse OpenOceanCloud community?
1. What principles and organizational structure will best enable an inclusive community?
How can OpenOceanCloud empower scientists, citizens, local communities, and environmental justice groups to make the most of ocean data and data science to advance their own diverse goals?  How do we reach those beyond the traditional privileged oceanographic institutions?
1. Publishing: how should OpenOceanCloud integrate with the traditional publishing workflow? How can we publish open, reproducible research artifacts? How can we provide career incentives for oceanographers to engage in open science?

#### Theme 3: (Amplification Activities) How can OpenOceanCloud support and amplify other U.N. Ocean Decade Activities?
1. How do we connect and build bridges with existing efforts?
1. Who are early adopter communities that we could work with early on?
